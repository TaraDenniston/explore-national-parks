# Explore National Parks
Explore National Parks is a site where users can search for national parks in the United States via various search criteria, learn more about each park, and keep a list of favorite parks with their own notes about each park.

This site will make use of the [National Parks API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm)
